# Simple Panic Report Page

## Overview

This is a simplified version of the panic management page designed to properly consume the panic reports API endpoints and display emergency data in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Data Fetching**: Uses the `usePanicManagementData` hook to fetch panic reports from the API
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes data every 60 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with retry functionality
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching

### Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Reports**: Shows the total number of panic reports
- **Unresolved Reports**: Displays urgent reports requiring attention
- **Resolved Reports**: Shows successfully resolved emergencies
- **Recent Reports**: Reports from the last 24 hours

### Filtering & Search
- **Status Filter**: Filter by resolved/unresolved status
- **User Type Filter**: Filter by driver or rider reports
- **Real-time Filtering**: Filters are applied immediately without page reload

### Report Management
- **Report Details**: Comprehensive view of each panic report including:
  - User information (name, phone, email)
  - Location details (address, coordinates)
  - Associated booking information (if available)
  - Timestamp and description
- **Resolve Action**: One-click resolution of panic reports
- **View Details**: Expandable view for additional information

### Pagination
- **Page Navigation**: Simple previous/next navigation
- **Page Information**: Shows current page and total items
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/admin/panic-reports` - Fetch panic reports with filtering
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/panic-reports/{id}/resolve` - Resolve panic reports

### Data Structure
The page expects the following API response structure:

```typescript
interface PanicReportsResponse {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data: PanicReport[];
  pagination: {
    current_page: number;
    total_items: number;
    total_pages: number;
    limit: number;
  };
  statistics: {
    total_reports: number;
    resolved_reports: number;
    unresolved_reports: number;
    driver_reports: number;
    rider_reports: number;
    recent_reports: number;
  };
}
```

## Demo Mode

When `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` is set in the environment, the page will use demo data instead of making real API calls. This is useful for:
- Development and testing
- Demonstrations
- Offline development

## Error Handling

The page includes comprehensive error handling for:
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeouts
- **API Errors**: Server errors, authentication failures
- **Data Errors**: Invalid response formats, missing data
- **User Actions**: Failed resolve operations

## Performance Optimizations

- **React Query**: Efficient caching and background updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates for resolve actions
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Panic Reports section in the admin panel
2. View the statistics dashboard for an overview
3. Use filters to narrow down reports
4. Click "Resolve" to mark reports as resolved
5. Use pagination to navigate through large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Loading
- Check if demo mode is enabled (`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`)
- Verify API endpoint configuration
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure authentication token is valid

### Filters Not Working
- Verify filter parameters are being passed correctly
- Check API response structure
- Ensure backend supports the filter parameters

### Resolve Action Failing
- Check user permissions
- Verify panic report ID is valid
- Check network connectivity
- Review API error messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Map Integration**: Visual location display
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of reports
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date range, location-based filters
- **Bulk Actions**: Resolve multiple reports at once
- **Audit Trail**: Track who resolved reports and when
